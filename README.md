🌸 Flower Detection Project

This project is a Flower Detection / Classification system built using Deep Learning.
It allows users to upload flower images and get predictions using a trained model through a simple interface.

🚀 Features

Upload flower images for prediction

Deep Learning–based flower classification

Easy-to-use interface

Fast and accurate results

Modular and clean project structure

🧠 Model & Approach

Framework: TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch – update if needed)

CNN-based architecture

Trained on a flower image dataset

Model predicts flower category from input image

⚠️ Note: Model files (.h5, .pt, .keras) are not uploaded to GitHub due to size limits.
The model is loaded or downloaded at runtime.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch)

NumPy

OpenCV / PIL

Streamlit (if UI is used)

▶️ How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Clone the repository
https://github.com/22vidhi/flower-classification/tree/main
cd flower-project

2️⃣ Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Run the application
streamlit run app.py

📸 Sample Output

(Add screenshots of predictions here)

⚠️ Important Notes

Virtual environment (venv/) is excluded from GitHub

Large model files are ignored using .gitignore

Dataset is not included due to size constraints

🌱 Future Improvements

Add more flower categories

Improve accuracy with transfer learning

Deploy on cloud (Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face)

Add real-time camera detection
